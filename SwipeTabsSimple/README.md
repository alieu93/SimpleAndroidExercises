# Swipe Tabs Simple

# Description:

Simple application that utilizes the multiple tabs at the top of the action bar that a lot of apps including Facebook uses nowadays in their UI design. The idea is that you can easily swipe between multiple tabs (Fragments) that have their own separate thing. My own personal intention is to use this later in my Steam Store app to have multiple tabs that can have different categories (Upcoming Games, Games on Sale, etc).

Also, this combines my previous exercise with CardView/RecyclerViews for each individual tab/fragment in an attempt to demonstrate the combining of those two concepts. Again, this is for the sake of the Steam store app, which I will later integrate into it.
